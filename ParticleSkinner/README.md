# What is this?

This folder contains code to convert a cloud of particles into a smooth
triangular mesh. This is useful for rendering, since it's difficult to create
realistic renders of particle data. This code is developed by H. Bhattacharya, 
Y. Gao and A. W. Bargteil. I include it here because the cached fluid simulation
files are stored in the binary format accepted by this Particle Skinner. No
intermediate processing is required.


# From the Authors of ParticleSkinner

Thanks for downloading this code.  We hope you find it useful.  We'd
actually really like to see this code get used so if you have any
questions don't hesitate to contact us at:

adamb@cs.utah.edu or
hb123@cs.utah.edu

Most of the code has been pretty well tested.  The variable radius
code has been less so.  We think the knobs we've provided are
reasonable, but its hard to say for certain.  Some of the knobs
conflict with each other.  In this case the behavior is undefined :)

Cheers.
