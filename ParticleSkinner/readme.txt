Thanks for downloading this code.  We hope you find it useful.  We'd
actually really like to see this code get used so if you have any
questions don't hesitate to contact us at:

adamb@cs.utah.edu or
hb123@cs.utah.edu

Most of the code has been pretty well tested.  The variable radius
code has been less so.  We think the knobs we've provided are
reasonable, but its hard to say for certain.  Some of the knobs
conflict with each other.  In this case the behavior is undefined :)

Cheers.
